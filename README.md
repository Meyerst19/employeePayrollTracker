# employeePayrollTracker

employeePayrollTracker allows an employeer to collect employee data for the employees name and salary information. In JavaScript it is also calculating the average salary as well as randomly selecting a single employee. These additional calculations can be expanded upon in future releases and displayed outside of JS.
